# Stream
finance web tool using the oxf protocol, flask micro web framework  and request for HTTP 

## Intended Features
(1) Stream should aggregate all transactions across all institutions to a single stream of data for a seamless overview of your overall finances.
(2) Support tagging and learn tagging preferences. Does the title 'subway' cause the transaction (and all subsequent transactions) to be flagged as a 'food' tag even though it is for public transportation and not the food chain? This should fix that (real example from using Mint).
(3) Easy budgeting: support both monthly, recurring budgets based off of tags and flagged transactions in addition to simpler budgets with manual addition of transactions. Allows for easier, simpler ad-hoc budgets that may not rely on a schedule.
(4) Provide a total net worth based on your current finances.

This project has been shelved due to the amount of sensitive data it needs to interact with. At this time my knowledge of security is far too little give much confidence.
